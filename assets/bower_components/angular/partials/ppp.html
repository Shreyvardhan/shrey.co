			<p class="intro">People Power Partnership is an online portal that fights for the right of disadvantaged women to own and inherit property, which is a major socio-economic issue in developing countries like India.

			<p>People Power Partnership was borne out of my desire to start a grassroots movement focused on helping women reclaim their property and rights. It is a portal which connects organizations who help disadvantaged women and legal networks, so that these women are able to exercise their fundamental right to inherit and own property.</p>

			<p>The idea for Project PPP, my most ambitious project to date, came to me in the summer of 2016. Since then, I have reached out to the Delhi Government, numerous commissions for women, concerned government authorities, and multiple NGOs and legal organisations in an attempt to take this cause forward.</p>

			<p>The website, which has been completely designed and developed by me, can be seen <a href="http://peoplepowerpartnership.com" style="text-decoration: none;">here</a>.</p>
