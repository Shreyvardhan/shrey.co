			<h3 class="subhead">Hey, I'm Shrey.</h3>

			<p>I make things. </p>

			<p>Hailing from New Delhi, India, I'm currently a freshman at Harvard University, Class of 2022. Apart from being a full-time student, I'm an interaction designer and web developer based out of Cambridge, MA, passionate about solving problems. I believe that good design is as little design as possible, and this is something I try to reflect in my work â€” clean, yet elegant; simple, yet efficient.</p>

			<p><span class="read-less sm xs">I like solving problems with code, and in my free time, I enjoy working on personal projects and experimenting with new tools and languages.</p></span>

			<p class="italic">Currently looking &nbsp;for Summer 2019 Internships. <a href="mailto:mail@shrey.co">Get in touch.</a></p>
