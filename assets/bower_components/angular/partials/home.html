			<p>Hello. I&rsquo;m Shrey. I make things. </p>
							
			<p>I'm an interaction designer and web developer based in New Delhi, India passionate about solving problems. <a href="#" class="read-more xs"><i class="icon ion-ios-arrow-down"></i></a><span class="read-less xs">Currently aged 17, I am a highschool senior at The Mother's International School in New Delhi. I believe that good design is as little design as possible, and this is something I try to reflect in my work â€” clean, yet elegant; simple, yet efficient. <a href="#" class="read-more sm" readmore-click><i class="icon ion-ios-arrow-down"></i></a></span></p>

			<p><span class="read-less sm xs">I like solving problems with code, and in my free time, I enjoy working on personal projects and experimenting with new tools and languages.</p></span>
