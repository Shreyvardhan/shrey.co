			<p class="intro">One of my earliest projects, TicTacToe was the first project I made that utilised my (then) recently acquired skills of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

			<p>An extremely simple project, TicTacToe is nothing but a digital version of the widely popular game of the same name. The inspiration for this project was my school's firewall, which blocked all sorts of games.</p>

			<p>Not only did this digital version of TicTacToe help me bypass this obstacle and ward off boredom, it was also a stepping stone for much more complex projects in the near future.</p>

			<p>The game can be played against a friend (multiplayer mode) or against a computer (single player mode), and can be found <a href="http://shrey.co/tictactoe" style="text-decoration: none;">here</a>.</p>
