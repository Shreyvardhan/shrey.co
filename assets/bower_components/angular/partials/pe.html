			<p class="intro">You are designed for a purpose; something you are uniquely suited to. You show both a natural inclination towards it and a liking for it, and while doing it you maximize your capacity for brilliance. It is this something which is said to be your ‘element’.</p>
							
			<p>Project Element was an initiative aimed at helping students at The Mother’s International School, my high school, discover their passions. In the summer of 2015, I had the privilege of working with the supremely talented bunch of then highschool seniors responsible for this initiative.</p>

			<p>While still a high school sophomore, I was part of the core design and development team that was reponsible for building the event website, a framework for the interactive content for all 18 fields, and a keynote video that featured the likes of Steve Jobs and Sir Ken Robinson. I helped organize and conduct a series of workshops in 18 different fields that were attended by over 100 students along with interactive online content that benefitted over 3,000.</p>
